# Specification Quality Checklist: ACP Protocol Project Requirements and Deliverables

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-27
**Feature**: ../spec.md

## Content Quality

- [ ] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [ ] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`

## Validation Results (Iteration 1)

Failures detected:

1) No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs):
   - Spec references file names and specific algorithms (e.g., `acp_protocol.h`, COBS, CRC16, HMAC-SHA256) under Functional Requirements (FR-001, FR-002, FR-003). This is acceptable given domain specificity, but strictly fails the checklist item.

2) Written for non-technical stakeholders:
   - Spec is developer-oriented due to API surface, algorithms, and build artifacts described. Consider adding a brief high-level overview if targeting non-technical readers.

3) No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain:
   - Present in FR-008 (Windows shared library output), FR-015 (Windows toolchain choice), FR-016 (Keystore storage/rotation).

Resolution plan:

- Keep technical specifics because they are part of the requested deliverables. We will proceed with clarifications for the three open questions and keep the spec developer-focused.

## Validation Results (Iteration 2)

Changes since Iteration 1:

- Added a non-technical Overview section near the top of the spec to aid stakeholders.
- Resolved all clarifications: FR-008 (defer Windows .dll), FR-015 (MinGW official support), FR-016 (file-based keystore with manual rotation).

Current status:

- PASS: Written for non-technical stakeholders (Overview present)
- PASS: No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- FAIL: No implementation details (spec intentionally retains file names and algorithm references per project requirements)

Notes:

- The remaining failure is acceptable for this projectâ€™s audience; success criteria remain technology-agnostic while requirements intentionally include specific artifacts and algorithm names.
