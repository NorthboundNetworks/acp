## Dependencies (story completion order)

- US1 depends on: COBS + CRC (T013–T015)
- US2 depends on: US1 core + HMAC/session/keystore (T016–T018)
- US3 depends on: Setup + core build targets (T001–T008, T009–T012)
- US4 can run after Foundational; may proceed in parallel with US3

## Parallel execution examples

## Implementation strategy

- MVP: Deliver US1 end-to-end (encode/decode + tests). Then add US2 authentication, followed by US3 build artifacts and US4 shims.
- Keep zero-heap default; use explicit buffers and lengths in APIs.
- Enforce network byte order in wire format functions.
- Add CI early to avoid drift across platforms.

## Validation

- Checklist format: All tasks follow `- [ ] T### [P]? [USn]? Description with file path`.
- File paths are absolute.
- Each user story includes goal, independent test criteria, and tasks that make the story independently testable.
